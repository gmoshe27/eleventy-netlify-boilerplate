Scott Hanselman did an AMA-style interview on Discord with Jeff Fritz of Twitch fame. The interview was fairly open-ended, but most of the questions were centered around how to improve in software development, how to improve in life, and how to overcome imposter syndrome.

## Highlights
- Set a life goal and remove things in your life that don't help you achieve that goal
- Improve a skill through [deliberate practice](https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory)
- [Don't waste your keystrokes](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DoTheyDeserveTheGiftOfYourKeystrokes.aspx) This blog started because of this comment
- Interviewing techniques are similar to improv, where you say "yes, and!"
- [Terry Gross](https://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/) from NPR's earlier Fresh Air shows is a great example of how to navigate an interview
- Check your imposter syndrome by understanding that your life and choices are different than the one you're comparing it to. Accept it and move on.
- Don't miss an opportunity to spend time with your family or friends. If you do, ask yourself immediately if you can correct it.
