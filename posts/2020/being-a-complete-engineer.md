Scott Hanselman interviewed Bryan Liles who is a senior software engineer at VM Ware. He and Scott talked about Bryan's anxiety. Bryan explains that his anxiety requires him to live by certain rules. Inclusive in those rules is to not compare himself to other people. Scott and Bryan talked about how to level up the people around them. As you rise, those around you should rise.

There are moments that we see when people do amazing things. If we compare ourselves to those people and their successes, we're not comparing ourselves to all of the work and effort that lead to that success. It also might have been a one-time success. You can appreciate it, applaud it, and work on your own thing or the things that you like.

If we give the best of ourselves, the people around us will improve. Simply helping with introductions can mean a huge deal to someone in a lesser position than you.
