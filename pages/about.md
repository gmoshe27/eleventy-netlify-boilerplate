Have you ever wanted to share that one video, book, podcast, song, etc.. with someone and had a hard time finding it because you chanced upon it so long ago? Well this happens to me a lot, and this website is my way of making it easy for me to find those things. I wanted an easy way to search through a history of the things that influence me, or inspired me. I don't intend to post everything that I read or listen to, just the high quality items that received my attention.

My interests are quite broad, but I'm mainly a software engineer at work, an amateur classical guitarist in my spare time, and a father and husband at home. If you're here, it's because you found something that inspired us both, and probably on one of those subjects.

Now that I have your attention, check out my youtube channel, [Gad Plays Guitar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClJ67PyjtH6BWYMpPUpD1ZQ) :D
